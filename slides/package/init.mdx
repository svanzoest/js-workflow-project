## Yarn

Manages dependencies and package definition

- init
- add/upgrade/remove/outdated
- install
- pack
- publish
- audit
- licenses

---

import { Notes } from 'mdx-deck'

## Create package definition

Create an initial package.json file

- `yarn init` 
- `yarn create react-app <my-app>`

<Notes>
Running yarn create react-app will start by doing the same thing as 
`yarn global add create-react-app`. 

Then, once the package installed, Yarn will run the executable located in the bin field of the newly installed packageâ€™s package.json, forwarding to it any remaining command line argument.
</Notes>

- `yarn install`

---
